# Solution Steps

1. 1. Define the User model in SQLAlchemy with columns for id, username, role, and status, and ensure 'role' and 'status' are indexed for efficient filtering.

2. 2. Create a Pydantic schema (UserRead) for serializing user data with id, username, role, and status fields, and enable orm_mode.

3. 3. Set up an async database connection in app/database.py using SQLAlchemy's async engine and sessionmaker, and make a dependency for getting async sessions.

4. 4. In FastAPI's app/main.py, instantiate an app, and implement the GET /users endpoint to accept optional 'role' and 'status' query params.

5. 5. Build a query that filters users by role and/or status if those query parameters are supplied, combining filters as appropriate.

6. 6. Execute the query asynchronously, fetch the matching results, serialize them with the UserRead schema, and return as the response.

7. 7. Handle errors gracefully in the endpoint, returning a 500 error and generic message on unexpected exceptions.

8. 8. Add a Dockerfile to containerize the FastAPI app, installing requirements and running uvicorn.

9. 9. Add a docker-compose.yml file for orchestrating the FastAPI app and a PostgreSQL database, with correct environment variables and network settings.

10. 10. Add requirements.txt to specify project dependencies.

11. 11. Create an empty __init__.py in the app directory to mark it as a Python package.

12. 12. Document the API endpoint using FastAPI's automatic documentation, accessible at /docs.

13. 13. Build and start the stack with Docker Compose, ensuring the app connects to the database, and the /users endpoint provides correct filtered results.
